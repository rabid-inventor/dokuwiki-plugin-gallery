gallery Plugin for DokuWiki

Main documentation for this plugin can be found at
http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:gallery

The following extra options are only in this fork
fancybox        - need fancybox installed inside the gallery folder called fancybox
fancyslideshow  - 
cyclepics       - takes all the images and shows only one box and cycles through them
page            - makes links to a wiki page with the same name as the title of the image 
page_trimnumbers- removes any numbers from the end of the name
page_useid      - use the pageid instead of title

fancybox is available from fancyapps.com/fancybox/#license

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/gallery/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
